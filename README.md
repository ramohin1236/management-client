# React 

### server-side-link: https://github.com/ramohin1236/management-server

#### I used React in this project

## 1. The project doesn't  using any authentication system.

## 2. The project says that if any user submits information so that his data goes to this email test@nusaiba.com.bd in PDF format. It has been used.

### 3. If the data is reloaded for the first time, then please reload and hope the problem will be solved quickly

      * axios
      * tailwind css
